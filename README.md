# Concurrent B+ Tree with Log-Structured Storage

## Overview

This project implements a concurrent B+ tree data structure with log-structured storage for efficient persistence and recovery. The B+ tree is designed to support multi-threaded insertions while ensuring data integrity through optimistic locking. The persistent log allows for crash recovery, making it suitable for applications requiring high reliability.

## Features

- **Concurrent Insertions**: Utilize multi-threading for simultaneous data insertions with version control to avoid conflicts.
- **Log-Structured Storage**: Efficiently manage writes with a log-based approach, utilizing data compression for storage optimization.
- **Crash Recovery**: Recover the B+ tree structure from a persistent log in the event of a system failure.
- **Benchmarking**: Measure and visualize the performance of insertion operations under concurrent conditions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

### Running the Benchmark

To run the benchmark and visualize the results, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

The benchmark will simulate multiple insertion operations and plot the distribution of operation times.

### Key Classes

- **BPlusTreeNode**: Represents a node in the B+ tree, supporting insertion and size calculations.
- **LogStructuredStore**: Manages the persistent log, handling data compression and recovery.
- **ConcurrentBPlusTree**: Provides a concurrent interface for the B+ tree with support for optimistic locking.
- **Benchmark**: Conducts performance tests and visualizes the results.

## Code Structure

- `bplus_tree.py`: Contains the implementation of the B+ tree and its nodes.
- `log_storage.py`: Implements the log-structured storage for persisting operations.
- `benchmark.py`: Manages the benchmarking process.
- `main.py`: The entry point for running the benchmark and performing recovery tests.

## Example

```python
# Example of inserting into the concurrent B+ tree
tree = ConcurrentBPlusTree()
tree.insert(key=1, value="Example Value")
```

## Visualization

After running the benchmark, the average insertion time and a histogram of insertion times will be displayed, helping to analyze the performance.

## Testing Crash Recovery

The system simulates a crash and then recovers the B+ tree from the persistent log. This feature ensures data integrity and resilience in real-world applications.
